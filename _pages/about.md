I am currently a PhD student at The Ohio State University studying computer science and engineering, advised by [Dr. Christopher Stewart](https://www.reroutlab.org/) and [Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf](https://cse.osu.edu/people/berger-wolf.1). I graduated with a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from OSU. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at General Electric, Georgia Pacific, and LBrands. I also participated in several short-term study abroad programs, including trips to India, Greece, Switzerland, and the U.K. After graduation, I worked as a Data Services product owner at Bath & Body Works in Columbus, Ohio. 

Research Interests
======

My research is focused on building resilient edge architecture for autonomous, unmanned aerial vehicles (AUAVs) for applications in ecology and agriculture. AUAVs use software to decide where to fly, when to collect data, and when to end a mission without humans in the loop. AUAVs employ edge computing, a distributed computing paradigm wherein computational resources, i.e., servers, near AUAVs can offload image processing workloads in place of cloud computing resources. My research focuses on building resilient edge architecture designed to enable long-term, multi-mission AUAV swarms through streaming workload semantics and resilient, elastic, and disaggregated placements.
