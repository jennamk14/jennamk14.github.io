I am currently a PhD student at The Ohio State University studying computer science and engineering, advised by [Dr. Christopher Stewart](https://www.reroutlab.org/) and [Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf](https://cse.osu.edu/people/berger-wolf.1). I graduated with a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering from The Ohio State University in 2018. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at General Electric, Georgia Pacific, and LBrands. I also participated in several short-term study abroad programs, including trips to India, Greece, Switzerland, and the U.K. After graduation, I worked as a Data Services Product Owner at Bath & Body Works in Columbus, Ohio. 

This summer I will be interning at Los Alamos National Laboratory with the Supercomputer Institute.

Research Interests
======

My research is focused on building resilient edge architecture and intelligent navigation models for autonomous, unmanned aerial vehicles (AUAVs) for applications in ecology and agriculture. AUAVs use software to decide where to fly, when to collect data, and when to end a mission without humans in the loop. Edge architecture optimized for AUAVs brings compute close to the data source, enabling real-time analysis and reducing latency, and efficiently manages the unpredictable workloads generated by autonomous navigation models.
