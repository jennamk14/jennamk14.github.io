I collaborated with a team of fellow student in the Honors Integrated Business and Engineering Program (IBE) to create a prototype and present a business plan to solve the problem of providing affordable, safe water to the global community. During this research project, I spent two weeks working at CERN, the European Council for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland at the IdeaSquare prototyping facility collaborating with CERNâ€™s Knowledge Transfer team and built a working water purification prototype.
