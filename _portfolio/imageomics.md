This past January I traveled to Mpala Research Center in Kenya to conduct biological field research as part of the Experiential Introduction to Imageomics course. I collaborated with students and faculty from The Ohio State University, Virginia Tech, Princeton, and Tulane University to study the behavior of zebras and giraffes using drones. My research focuses on developing resilient edge architecture for autonomous drone swarms for digital agriculture and animal ecology, so I was very excited to get hands-on experience and learn how drones can help ecologists to better collect data. The drone allowed us to collect much clearer video footage of the zebras compared to traditional methods of data collection using hand-held cameras. Currently, I am working with a team to build an end-to-end pipeline that will automatically identify individual animals and behaviors from the drone videos using computer vision and machine learning. In addition, I am using the drone data I collected in Kenya to create drone swarms that can carry out these flights autonomously, so more exciting updates to come soon!
