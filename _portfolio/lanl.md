I interned at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in northern New Mexico with the [Supercomputer Institute Summer School](https://www.lanl.gov/projects/national-security-education-center/information-science-technology/summer-schools/cscnsi/index.php). 
I completed a 3 week hands-on HPC bootcamp, which included assembling and configuring a 11-node HPC cluster. We used 11 GB servers (R272-Z32-00) for our nodes, and connected using Mellanox EDR Infiniband switch for fast communication (100 Gbps). 
I used netboot to practice manually configure the stateless cluster, before using Warewulf to provision the cluster automatically. 
I set up Slurm on the cluster to manage resources and scheduling, and Ansible for configuration management.

I completed a project  analyzing 6 HPC filesystems maintained by LANL, titled "Seeing the trees for the forest:
Describing HPC Filesystems with the Grand Unified File-Index (GUFI)." [Abstract](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/hpc/_assets/docs/mini-showcase-abstracts/GUFIfores.pdf) &
