Land-use policies driven by precise, real-time, and holistic maps can improve food security, mitigate the effects of climate change, and support resilient ecosystems. My research focuses on building innovative, new software applications to improve land-use policies using autonomous, unmanned aerial vehicles (AUAVs), called software-defined cartography (SDC). AUAVs use software to decide where to fly, when to collect data, and when to end a mission without humans in the loop, enabling them to map vast areas quickly and affordably. I am currently working on building SDC applications for use-cases in digital agriculture, resilient forestry, and animal ecology. I plan to use this talk to present on this exciting, interdisciplinary area of AUAV and edge computing research.
