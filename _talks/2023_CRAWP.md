Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (AUAVs) use software to decide where to fly, when to collect data, and when to end a mission without humans in the loop. AUAVs can map vast areas quickly and affordably, and collect high-quality photos and videos. These AUAV missions can capture fine-grained details, such as animal social interactions, previously unavailable to researchers. Furthermore, UAVs can traverse remote terrain more quickly and with lesser disturbance to wildlife than motorized vehicles. Manually piloted UAVs have been used by ecologists to gather data, including time budgets, focal and scan sampling, and demographic information, such as species, age, and gender. Current efforts to utilize UAVs to gather data for animal ecology applications are constrained by the availability of trained pilots who can conduct missions tailored to the geographic region and species. Combing UAVs with machine learning techniques to make missions fully autonomous significantly reduces the barriers to utilizing UAV technology to collect high-quality animal ecology data in the field. Collecting census information about the population sizes of endangered species is an important component of conservation efforts. Gathering photos to identify individual animals is a time consuming and manual process. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) piloted autonomously are well-suited to capture identifying photos due to their speed and vantage point reduces the obfuscation of vegetation. The aim of the project is to build an end-to-end pipeline to individually identify zebras from images captured by UAVs.
