Collecting census information about the population sizes of endangered species is an important component of conservation efforts. Gathering photos to identify individual animals is a time consuming and manual process. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) piloted autonomously are well-suited to capture identifying photos due to their speed and vantage point reduces the obfuscation of vegetation. The aim of the project is to build an end-to-end pipeline to individually identify zebras from images captured by UAVs.
