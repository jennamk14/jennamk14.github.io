Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (AUAVs) use software to decide where to fly, when to collect data, and when to end a mission without humans in the loop. AUAVs can map vast areas quickly and affordably, which has applications in digital agriculture, resilient forestry, and animal ecology. I envision software-defined cartography where AUAVs create virtual maps that allow users to control (1) the mapped attribute, (2) geospatial accuracy, and (3) computational costs. By virtualizing the control plane, software-defined cartography could enable transformative and interdisciplinary applications for AUAVs. Software-defined cartography also presents new challenges in resource management, especially at far-edge computing sites where AUAVs collect and process data. I plan to build a new edge computing platform designed to handle large computer vision AI workloads at the edge while also providing low-latency and efficiently utilizing compute resources.
