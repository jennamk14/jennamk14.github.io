*Abstract* Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (AUAVs) use algorithms to decide where to fly, when to collect data, and when to end a mission without humans in the loop. AUAVs can map vast areas quickly and affordably to collect high-quality photos and videos. AUAVs can traverse remote terrain more quickly and with less disturbance than motorized vehicles, such as heavy-duty ATVs or SUVs. Current efforts to utilize UAVs to gather data for interdisciplinary applications, including agriculture, forestry, defense, and ecology, are constrained by the availability of trained pilots who can conduct missions tailored to the geographic region and mission. Combining UAVs with machine learning techniques to make missions fully autonomous significantly reduces barriers for using AUAVs to collect high-quality data in the field.  We present a recent work using AUAVs to collect videos of wildlife behavior at the Mpala Research Centre in Laikipia County, Kenya. We also present an autonomous navigation policy for AUAV wildlife behavior data collection, which has an F1-score of 82% compared to an expert pilot, and provides greater safety and consistency, suggesting great potential for state-of-the-art autonomous approaches if they can be scaled up to fully address the problem. The aim of this presentation is to use this case study to increase awareness of the opportunities for contributions in computer vision, machine learning, edge computing, and interdisciplinary computer science research to encourage broader participation of historically excluded groups in computing to pursue research in these areas. 

Key concepts: autonomous navigation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), interdisciplinary research, broadening participation
